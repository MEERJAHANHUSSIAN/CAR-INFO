                                6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine that produces around 563 horsepower and 664
                                lb-ft of torque. It’s designed to deliver smooth, near-silent acceleration with
                                effortless power delivery, staying true to the brand’s signature "waftability" — where
                                the engine feels like it glides rather than accelerates.</p>
